    "# ### What is a Language Model?\n",
    "# A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. Given such a sequence, say of length m, it assigns a probability $P(w_1, \\ldots, w_m)$ to the whole sequence. A good language model assigns a higher probability to sequences that actually do appear in the language.\n"

    "# Language models are important because they help us answer the question: How likely is a given sequence of words? This question is useful for a large number of natural language processing applications including speech recognition, machine translation, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, information retrieval and other applications.\n"

    "# A large language model is a language model that is trained on a large amount of data. The amount of data required to train a large language model is dependent on the size of the vocabulary and the complexity of the language. For example, English is a more complex language than French, and thus requires more data to train a large language model.\n"

    "# A transformer is a neural network architecture that is used to train large language models. It was introduced in the paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. in 2017. The transformer architecture is based on the idea of attention, which is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on certain parts of the input sequence when computing the output sequence. The transformer architecture is composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is used to encode the input sequence into a vector representation, and the decoder is used to decode the vector representation into an output sequence. The transformer architecture is used to train large language models because it is able to learn long-range dependencies between words in a sequence.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Multi-Head Attention: This is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on certain parts of the input sequence when computing the output sequence. It is composed of multiple attention heads, each of which is used to compute a different attention vector. The attention vectors are then concatenated and passed through a linear layer to produce the final output vector.\n",

    "- Feed-Forward Network: This is a neural network that is used to transform the input vector into a new vector. It is composed of two linear layers with a ReLU activation function in between.\n",

    "- Layer Normalization: This is a normalization technique that is used to normalize the output vector of the feed-forward network. It is used to improve the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Residual Connections: This is a technique that is used to improve the performance of the model. It is used to prevent the model from forgetting the input vector.\n",
